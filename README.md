﻿Party List Control 

HI Team  

If you want to develop a custom Partly list as like Email’s To, CC

This control basically having multiple lookup records into single column that is called party list column.  

But Microsoft did not provide any custom solution for this if you want to build your own. 

I also came up with a similar problem where customer want to store multiple lookups of contact record into one column so that I have created a generic PCF Control Which will be applied on sub grid of N to N. 

For this problem we have created a N-to-N Relationship between two tables then I have applied this control on that grid so when you will add any new contact it will be added to sub grid. 

If you remove any contact, it will be removed from the sub grid itself. 

**Note: - for this PCF control you need to maximum no rows to 250.**
